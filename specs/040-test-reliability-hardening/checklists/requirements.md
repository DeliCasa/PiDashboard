# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Reliability & Hardening

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references specific file paths and error messages as evidence for the current state, not as implementation prescriptions. The "what" is described (fixture files must exist, frontmatter must be valid) without prescribing "how" at the implementation level.
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for all ambiguous areas — no clarification markers needed.
